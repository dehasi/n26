### Code Challenge

We would like to have a restful API for our statistics. The main use case for our API is to
calculate realtime statistic from the last 60 seconds. There will be two APIs, one of them is
called every time a transaction is made. It is also the sole input of this rest API. The other one
returns the statistic based of the transactions of the last 60 seconds.

### Specs

```
POST /transactions
```

Every Time a new transaction happened, this endpoint will be called.

Body:
```
{
  "amount": 12.3,
  "timestamp": 1478192204000
}
```

```
GET /statistics
```

This is the main endpoint of this task, this endpoint have to execute in constant time and
memory (O(1)). It returns the statistic based on the transactions which happened in the last 60
seconds.

Returns
```
{
  "sum": 1000,
  "avg": 100,
  "max": 200,
  "min": 50,
  "count": 10
}
```
